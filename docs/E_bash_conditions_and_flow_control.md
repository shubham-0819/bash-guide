<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: It is worth mentioning that you can replace all the double square brackets with single square brackets for example :  `[[ NUM -eq NUM ]]`   can also be written as `[ NUM -eq NUM ]` . This works with all the all conditions except for compound conditions which uses `-a` (AND) and `-o` (OR) as logical operators.

## Advanced if-then Features

- Single parentheses `(.......)` allow you to use subshells in your if statement comparisons.
- The double parentheses `(( epression ))` command allows you to incorporate advanced mathematical formulas in your comparisons. [check out performing arithmetic operations.](Arithmetic%20operations%202db420ef5c0f402b82a9b958f56e8b19.md)
- The double bracket `[[.......]]` command provides advanced features for string comparisons.
