# Getting Started with Bash Scripting

Bash is a Unix shell, which is a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. It is widely used for various purposes such as automation, task management, and more. This guide will help you understand the basics of bash scripting and how to get started with writing your own bash scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before you start writing bash scripts, you should have a basic understanding of the following:

* The command line interface
* Basic Linux/Unix commands
* Familiarity with programming concepts (e.g., variables, loops, functions, etc.)

## Setting up the environment

To start writing bash scripts, you will need a text editor and a terminal. Most Linux/Unix systems come with a terminal and the vi or nano text editor installed by default. If you're using Windows, you can install a Linux environment such as Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Writing your first script

Bash scripts are simply text files with a .sh extension that contain a series of commands to be executed. To create your first script, follow these steps:

* Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to save your script.
* Create a new file using the nano text editor by typing nano myscript.sh.
* Type the following code into the file

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
* Save the file and exit the text editor.
* Make the script executable by typing chmod +x myscript.sh.
* Run the script by typing ./myscript.sh.
